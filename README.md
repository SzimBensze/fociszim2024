# fociszim2024
A rework of a rework of a football simulator, but this time it is a Java-based project. I intend to make it much more extensive and visually appealing than the past instances. Check out my previous version "[fociszim2023](https://github.com/SzimBensze/fociszim2023)" for more introduction and interesting stuff.

## WIP
This project is heavily work-in-progress and is in an early stage. This is a private project, you may examine the code and clone the repository for personal use. Do not copy, edit or share without permission!

## How to play
There is currently no artifacts or executable versions, so please use a Java IDE of your choice to be able to execute the code. This will be resolved later on, however this is the only method to run the program for now. Navigate to the "Main.java" class in your IDE and click execute/run. The game is currently a console application where you have to enter the parameters of two teams similarly to a FIFA video game's team structure.
1. Answer whether the match is played in a home stadium or a foreign location.
2. Answer whether you'd like the float values of chances to be displayed during the match. These numbers are used for calculations while the match is in progress.
3. Enter the first team's name, attack, midfield and defense points.
4. Enter the formation you'd prefer, this gives buffs to the already existing points. You can check the list of the available formations in the corresponding file.
5. Repeat the same for the other team.
6. Press enter and the match starts instantly.
8. If the match ends in a tie you can choose to continue with extra time and penalties.
9. Have fun!

## Troubleshooting
As already mentioned, this project is still in a work-in-progress stage, so many bugs and crashes can occur. If you experience any issues feel free to notify me on GitHub or via Discord: @szimbensze (SzimBensze#7577)
